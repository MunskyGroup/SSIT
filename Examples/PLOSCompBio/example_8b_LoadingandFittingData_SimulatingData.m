%% Create a complicated model to simulate noisy real data

% Create a copy of the STL1 model for simulation:
STL1_sim_model = STL1_FSP_4state;

% Update propensity function for the gene activation reaction:
STL1_sim_model.propensityFunctions{1} = 'offGene * IHog';

% Define the time-varying TF/MAPK input signal with added noise:
STL1_sim_model.inputExpressions = {'IHog',...
               'a0 + a1*exp(-r1*t)*(1-exp(-r2*t))*(t>0) + sigma'};

% Add the new parameters from the TF/MAPK input signal:
STL1_sim_model.parameters = ({'koff',0.01; 'kr',100; 'gr',0.5; ...
'kleak',0.5; 'a0',0.01; 'a1',10; 'r1',0.004; 'r2',.01; 'sigma',randn(1)*5});
% Note that the simulated data will differ each time it is run.

% Set stoichiometry of reactions:
STL1_sim_model.stoichiometry = [-1,1,0,0,0;...
                                 1,-1,0,0,0;...
                                 0,0,1,-1,1]; 

% Set propensity functions:
STL1_sim_model.propensityFunctions{5} = 'kleak'; 

% Print a summary of STL1 Model:
STL1_sim_model.summarizeModel

%% Generate simulated time-varying STL1 yeast data for fitting later

% Number of independent data sets to generate:
STL1_sim_model.ssaOptions.Nexp = 2;  

% Number of cells to include at each time point for each data set:
STL1_sim_model.ssaOptions.nSimsPerExpt = 200;

% Ensure the solution scheme is set to FSP (default):
    STL1_sim_model.solutionScheme = 'FSP';  

% This function compiles and stores the given reaction propensities  
% into symbolic expression functions that use sparse matrices to  
% operate on the system based on the current state. The functions are 
% stored with the given prefix, in this case, 'STL1_FSP'
STL1_sim_model = STL1_sim_model.formPropensitiesGeneral('STL1_sim_FSP');
    
% Set FSP 1-norm error tolerance:
STL1_sim_model.fspOptions.fspTol = 1e-4; 
    
% Guess initial bounds on FSP StateSpace:
STL1_sim_model.fspOptions.bounds = [2,2,400];
    
% Have FSP approximate the steady state for the initial distribution 
% by finding the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest magnitude 
% eigenvalue (i.e., zero, for generator matrix A, d/dtP(t)=AP(t)):
STL1_sim_model.fspOptions.initApproxSS = false; 
    
% Solve Model:
[STL1_sim_FSPsoln,STL1_sim_model.fspOptions.bounds] = STL1_sim_model.solve;

% Generate and save data:
dataTable = STL1_sim_model.sampleDataFromFSP(STL1_sim_FSPsoln,...
                                             'data/STL1_sim.csv'); 

% Plot data as histograms:
for i = 1:4
    subplot(2,2,i)  % Switch to current subplot
    histogram(dataTable.exp1_s3(dataTable.time==STL1_sim_model.tSpan(i)),....
                                    30,"DisplayStyle","stairs")

%% Load time-varying STL1 yeast data 
%  * Now load simulated data and associate it with the models we set in

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Make new copies of our model:
Model_sim_data = Model_FSP;
STL1_sim_data = STL1_FSP;

% Load the simulated data, matching the species name of the model  
% (e.g., the model species 'offGene' is column 'exp1_s1' in the file):

Model_sim_data = Model_sim_data.loadData('data/STL1_sim.csv',...
                {'offGene','exp1_s1';'onGene','exp1_s2';'mRNA','exp1_s3'});

                {'offGene','exp1_s1';'onGene','exp1_s2';'mRNA','exp1_s3'});

% This plot is unnecessary, as the model parameters have not been fit to
% the data yet.  However, it illustrates the improvement to come later:
