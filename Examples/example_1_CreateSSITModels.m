%% Preliminaries:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Ex(1): Create a simple Bursting Gene model in SSIT
%%  This model consists of 3 species: 
%   an inactive gene ('offGene'), an activated gene ('onGene'), and mRNA. 
%%  There are four reactions, each with a unique rate parameter: 
%   activation ('kon'), inactivation ('koff'), transcription ('kr'), 
%   and mRNA degradation ('gr')
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Create an SSIT instance and call it 'Model':
Model = SSIT;    

% Set species names for bursting gene expression model:
Model.species = {'offGene';'onGene';'mRNA'}; 

% Set initial condition:
Model.initialCondition = [1;0;0];           

% Set stoichiometry of reactions:
Model.stoichiometry = [-1,1,0,0;...
                        1,-1,0,0;...
                        0,0,1,-1]; 

% Set propensity functions:
Model.propensityFunctions = {'kon * offGene';'koff * onGene';...
                             'kr * onGene';'dr * mRNA'}; 

% Set initial guesses for parameters:
Model.parameters = ({'kon',0.2; 'koff',0.2; 'kr',10; 'dr',5});

% Print a summary of STL1 Model:
Model.summarizeModel

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Ex(2): Copy the Bursting Gene Model above to a new model, 'STL1'.  
% The species, reactions, and stochiometries remain the same; 
% however, a change is made to the propensity for the first reaction 
% (gene activation) so that its rate is controlled by a time-varying 
% MAPK input signal. As a result, new parameters must also be added.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Create a copy of the simple Bursting Gene model from above:
STL1 = Model;

% Update propensity function for the gene activation reaction:
STL1.propensityFunctions{2} = 'onGene*koff/(1+Hog1)';

% Define a simplified time-varying TF/MAPK input signal:
STL1.inputExpressions = {'Hog1','(a0+a1*exp(-r1*t)*(1-exp(-r2*t))*(t>0))'};

% Add the new parameters from the TF/MAPK input signal:
STL1.parameters = ({'kon',0.2; 'koff',0.2; 'kr',10; 'dr',5;...
                    'a0',5; 'a1',10; 'r1',0.004; 'r2',.01}); 

% Print a summary of STL1 Model:
STL1.summarizeModel

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Ex(3): Copy the 'STL1' model for 4-state dynamics.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Create a copy of the STL1 model from above:
STL1_4state = STL1;

% Set species names for STL1_4state:
STL1_4state.species = {'g1';'g2';'g3';'g4';'mRNA'};

% Set initial condition:
STL1_4state.initialCondition = [1;0;0;0;0];  

% Set stoichiometry of reactions:
STL1_4state.stoichiometry = [-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0;...   % gene state 1
                              1,-1,-1,1,0,0,0,0;... % gene state 2
                              0,0,1,-1,-1,1,0,0;... % gene state 3        
                              0,0,0,0,1,-1,0,0;...  % gene state 4
                              0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1]     % mRNA
                 % Reactions: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8

% Add a lag to the time-varying TF/MAPK input signal:
STL1_4state.inputExpressions = ...
    {'Hog1','A*(((1-(exp(1)^(-r1*(t-t0))))*exp(1)^(-r2*(t-t0)))/(1+((1-(exp(1)^(-r1*(t-t0))))*exp(1)^(-r2*(t-t0)))/M))^n*(t>t0)'};

% Set propensity functions:
STL1_4state.propensityFunctions = {...
          'k12*g1';'(max(0,k21o*(1-k21i*Hog1)))*g2';...
          'k23*g2';'k32*g3';...
          'k34*g3';'k43*g4';...
          'kr4*g4';'dr*mRNA'}; 

% Add the new parameters for the 4 state model:
STL1_4state.parameters = ({'r1',35; 'r2',0.5; 'A',3; 'M',25; 'n',0.1; ...
                          't0',5.8; 'k21o',1e+03; 'k21i',1; ...
                          'k12',90; 'k23',5e+02; 'k34',5; ...
                          'k32',1000; 'k43',200; ...
                          'dr',1; 'kr4',2500});
