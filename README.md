The SSIT allows users to specify and solve the **Chemical Master Equation** (CME) for discrete stochastic models, especially those used for the analysis of single-cell gene regulaton.  

To learn more about the FSP theory that underlies the SSIT, please see the slides from our [Nov. 3, 2022 BPPB Seminar](https://github.com/MunskyGroup/SSIT/blob/main/images/BPPBSeminarNov2022.pdf)

Functionality includes:
  
- Build, save, and load models defined by their species, parameters, propensity functions, stoichiometries, and initial conditions
  * Models can be non-linear and have time-varying propensity functions (e.g., inputs), including logical statements
- Load from / export to SimBiology
  * Load from / export to SBML
- Solve models using: 
  * ODE analyses and basic moment closure analyses
- Stochastic trajectories generated by Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA)
  * Finite State Projection (FSP)
  * Hybrid solutions (deterministically + stochastically treated species population changes through time)
  * Reduced order models (Model Reduction) by:
    - Reduce models using Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSA) on fast species
    - Reduce models using eigenvalue decomposition
    - Reduce models using coarse meshes
    -  Reduce models using principle orthogonal decomposition
  * SSITMultiModel to create multiple models associated with different data sets with shared parameter sets
- Generate synthetic data from models using SSA 
- Compute sensitivity of solutions to parameter variations
- Compute the Fisher Information Matrix to determine the amount of parameter information available from the chosen experiment
- Compute first passage or escape time distributions for complex trajectories
- Load and fit experimental data (e.g., spot counts or total intensity measurements from smFISH images or flow cytometry)
- Compute the likelihood of the data given model
- Maximize the likelihood using gradient and non-gradient based searches
- Sample parameter uncertainty using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (with custom proposal distributions or proposal distributions based on Fisher Information)
- Include custom priors on parameter distributions for Bayesian analysis
- Model and account for experimental, measurement, and data processing noise
  * Explore effects of extrinsic noise in parameters
  * Calibrate empirical probability distortion operators (PDO) to quantify effects of data distortion
  * Include data distortion corrections in parameter estimation
- Inform and improve upon iterative experiment designs by searching an experiment design space for optimally informative experiments
  * Utilize the FSP-FIM approach to compare the amount of information gainable by each potential next experiment
  * Analyze possible next experiments using Bayesian sequential experiment design
  * Automatically adjust designs to account for data distortion effects (allowing for informative cheaper, faster experiments)
- Identify parameters that change with genetic / environmental / experimental conditions

# Installation and Testing
Clone this package to a local folder on your computer. Then, navigate to this new folder in matlab and run the installation script from the MATLAB command window.

```matlab
install    % Run script to set paths and check availability of SSIT codes.
```

```matlab
install(true) % Also run test scripts to check functionality of critical SSIT functions.
```

# Getting Started
The SSIT provides two basic interaction options: (1) command line tools and (2) a graphical user interface.

## GUI Version  
A GUI version of the SSIT has much of the functionality, and is a great way to familiarize yourself with the approach.  However, for intensive research tasks, we strongly recommend learning to use the more flexible and efficient command line tools. To get started with the GUI, compile and launch to tool kit with the following commands:

```matlab
A = SSITGUI;
```

You should then see the model loading and building page of the graphical interface, and you are off to the races...

Or you can start creating and solving models as follows.

Example for generating an FSI model and fitting it to smFISH data for Dusp1 activation following glucocorticoid stimulation:

**Define SSIT Model**

```matlab
install;
Model = SSIT;
Model.species = {'OnGene';'rna'};
Model.initialCondition = [0; 0];
Model.propensityFunctions = {'kon * IGR * (2-OnGene)'; 'koff * OnGene'; ...
    'kr * OnGene'; 'gr * rna'};
Model.stoichiometry = [1,-1,0,0; 0,0,1,-1];
Model.inputExpressions = {'IGR','a0 + a1 * exp(-r1 * t) * ...
    (1-exp(-r2 * t)) * (t>0)'};
Model.parameters = ({'koff',0.14; 'kon',0.14; 'kr',25; 'gr',0.01; ...
    'a0',0.006; 'a1',0.4; 'r1',0.04; 'r2',0.1});
Model.fspOptions.initApproxSS = true;  % Model is assumed to start at steady state at t=0;
```

**Load and Fit smFISH Data** (must be run in main SSIT directory)

```matlab
Model = Model.loadData('../ExampleData/DUSP1_Dex_100nM_Rep1_Rep2.csv', ...
    {'rna','RNA_nuc'});
Model.tSpan = unique([Model.initialTime,Model.dataSet.times]);
fitOptions = optimset('Display','iter','MaxIter',100);
[pars,likelihood] = Model.maximizeLikelihood([],fitOptions);
```

**Update Model and Make Plots of Results**

```matlab
Model.parameters(:,2) = num2cell(pars);
Model.makeFitPlot;
```

You should arrive at a fit of the model to the experimentally measured Dusp1 mRNA distributions looking something like this:
